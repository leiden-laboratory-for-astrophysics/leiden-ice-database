Welcome to Leiden Ice Database's documentation!
===============================================
Introduction
------------

The Leiden Ice Database for Astrochemistry (LIDA) for Astrochemistry host more than 1000 infrared spectra of solid-phase molecules in pure form or mixed in astrophysical relevant ice matrices. 
The ice spectra are also recorded in temperatures between 10 and ~100K, which are suitable for interstellar and circumstellar regions. The database also hosts UV/vis
refractive index of ice samples covering the range between 250 and 750 nm.

These data are publicly available via the LIDA website at `https://icedb.strw.leidenuniv.nl/ <https://icedb.strw.leidenuniv.nl/>`_

Putting in context, the LIDA will help in the data interpretation of observations obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Several hours are granted to observe ices
between 2022 and 2023. In particular, the Early Release Science `Ice Age <http://jwst-iceage.org/>`_ program (PI. Melissa McClure, co-PI. Harold Linnartz, Co-PI. Adwin Boogert) 
will observe different regions to track the ice properties at different stages of the protostellar evolution. A few other GO and GTO programs will also be dedicated to ice observations
in diverse astrophysical conditions. In this scenario, the LIDA has the primary goal to provide open-access experimental data, then creating the conditions to correctly interpret ice observations 
with JWST.

Features:
-----------

The Leiden Ice Database provides experimental data and astronomy-oriented online tools to help in the interpretation of ice observations with infrared telescopes. These features are created in
a user-friendly format to enhance the usability of the database. Additionally, interactive visualization tools are available to facilitate the experience of the users when using the database. 
Two online tools were create, where is possible to (i) calculate the complex refractive index of ices and (ii) construct synthetic spectra of protostars containing ice absorption features.

Citing the Leiden Ice Database
------------

If you use the data and/or the online tools of the Leiden Ice Database, please cite the paper describing the measurement and Rocha et al. (2021) (in prep.). 
For example, *This paper used the* C\ :sub:`3`\ H\ :sub:`6` O\  *spectra at 15K measured by* 
`Rachid et al. (2020) <https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2020/07/aa37497-20/aa37497-20.html>`_ 
*and made available through the Leiden Ice Database (Rocha et al. in prep.)*.
